   - ⚠️ **Scale sensitivity**: Performance degrades significantly with small datasets
   - ⚠️ **Memory overhead**: GA population-based search uses excessive resources

2. **Accuracy Performance**

   - ⚠️ **Convergence criteria**: May be stopping too early or too late
   - ⚠️ **Objective function**: Rank correlation optimization may not translate to imputation accuracy

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why Gower-PMM Underperforms

1. **GA Optimization Overhead**
   - The genetic algorithm adds 0.57 seconds of computation
   - This overhead may exceed the benefits of optimized weights
   - Small datasets (n=20) may not provide enough signal for optimization

2. **Weight Optimization vs. Equal Weights**
   - Equal weights (RMSE 2.28) outperform GA-optimized (RMSE 2.62)
   - Suggests the optimization may be finding suboptimal solutions
   - Or the optimization objective doesn't align with imputation accuracy

3. **Dataset Characteristics**
   - All variables are numeric, reducing Gower distance advantages
   - Small sample size limits GA effectiveness
   - MAR mechanism may not benefit from complex distance weighting

### Why Distance Engine Excels

1. **C++ Optimization Effective**
   - Pure computational task benefits greatly from C++ implementation
   - Distance calculations are embarrassingly parallel
   - Memory access patterns are optimized

2. **Algorithmic Maturity**
   - Gower distance calculation is well-understood
   - C++ implementation closely mirrors proven R algorithms
   - No complex optimization or search involved

## Validation Strategy

### When Gower-PMM Should Excel

Based on this analysis, Gower-PMM should show advantages when:

3. **Complex Relationships**: Variables have different scales or importance levels
4. **Multiple Imputations**: Weight optimization benefits accumulate over many imputations

### Recommended Test Cases

1. **Small mixed-type datasets** (n=50-100, mixed variables)
2. **Large numeric datasets** (n=1000+, numeric only) - to test GA scaling
3. **Complex categorical datasets** (many factors, ordinal variables)
4. **Longitudinal data** with time-varying missing patterns

## Conclusion

### Current Implementation Status

**Distance Engine**: ✅ **Excellent** - C++ optimization provides clear performance benefits
