Architecture and Implementation Plan: Optimized Gower-PMM Imputation
Version: 3.0
Date: September 17, 2025
Author: Winston, Architect

1. High-Level Architecture and Design Principles
1.1. Architectural Vision
The goal is to create a new, standalone imputation method, mice.impute.gowerpmm, that seamlessly integrates into the mice R package ecosystem. The architecture will be modular and high-performance, employing a hybrid R/C++ approach. The user-facing API will remain in R for ease of use and integration, while the computationally intensive core logic will be implemented in C++ with Rcpp and RcppArmadillo for maximum speed. The design will adhere to the coding conventions and API patterns of mature packages like mice and GA to ensure a professional, maintainable, and user-friendly final product [cite: amices/mice/mice-0946cd35433f7319fa1df7cf2d1e12d69de942ba/R/mice.impute.pmm.R, timoyaj/ga/GA-175abd1d5f00b851283daa0f2fcfd5346046cd05/R/ga.R].

1.2. Core Components
The implementation will be logically divided into three primary modules:

The High-Performance C++ Backend: A set of C++ functions, exposed to R via Rcpp, that will handle all performance-critical calculations, including dissimilarity matrix generation and rank correlation computations.

The R Interface and Optimization Module: A suite of R functions that provide a user-friendly interface to the C++ backend, orchestrate the weight optimization using the GA package, and manage user inputs and results.

The mice Integration Layer: The main mice.impute.gowerpmm function, which will serve as the entry point for the mice framework and will include crucial performance enhancements like caching.

1.3. Technical Stack

Primary Language: R, with C++ for performance-critical components.

Core Dependencies:

mice: For the base imputation framework [cite: amices/mice/mice-0946cd35433f7319fa1df7cf2d1e12d69de942ba/DESCRIPTION].

FD: The logic from gowdis() will be reimplemented and enhanced in C++ to serve as our base Gower engine, ensuring correct handling of ordinal variables [cite: uploaded:gowdis.R, uploaded:pani gower _content_11.pdf].

GA: For the Genetic Algorithm solver, chosen for its robustness with non-differentiable objective functions [cite: uploaded:Optimizing Gower Dissimilarity Weights via Rank Correlation Balancing for Missing Value Imputation].

Rcpp & RcppArmadillo: For seamless R and C++ integration and efficient linear algebra.

parallel & doParallel: For automatic parallelization of the optimization process.

Testing: testthat, to align with the mice package's testing infrastructure [cite: amices/mice/mice-0946cd35433f7319fa1df7cf2d1e12d69de942ba/tests/testthat.R].

├── DESCRIPTION
└── NAMESPACE

2.2. Component 1: The High-Performance C++ Backend

Files: src/distance_calculations.cpp, src/rank_correlations.cpp, src/objective_function.cpp

Description: This is the computational core of the package, written in C++ for maximum performance.

Key Functions (to be exported to R via Rcpp::export):

compute_dissimilarities_cpp: Efficiently calculates and returns a 3D Armadillo cube of per-variable dissimilarity matrices.

spearman_correlation_cpp: A fast implementation of Spearman's rank correlation.

objective_function_cpp: The core fitness function for the GA, which takes the pre-computed dissimilarity cube and a weight vector, and returns the objective value.

Integration Snippet (R/RcppExports.R): This file will be generated automatically by Rcpp::compileAttributes(). The R code will call these C++ functions using .Call(), which provides the lowest-level, highest-performance interface.

# Example of how R will call the C++ objective function
# This call is embedded within the GA solver
fitness_value <- .Call(`_gowerpmm_objective_function_cpp`, weights, dissim_matrices, "spearman")

2.3. Component 2: R Interface and Optimization Module

File: R/optimization_helpers.R

Description: This module provides the user-facing API for the optimization process, following the best practices of the GA package [cite: timoyaj/ga/GA-175abd1d5f00b851283daa0f2fcfd5346046cd05/R/ga.R].

Key Functions and Classes:

gowerpmmControl(): A control function for specifying GA parameters, the scaling method, etc.

optimal_gower_weights S4 Class: A formal class to structure the results from the optimization, with slots for @weights, @objective_value, @rank_correlations, and @ga_summary.

calculate_optimal_gower_weights(): The main R wrapper that sets up parallel processing and calls the GA::ga solver with the C++ fitness function.

Integration Snippet (Parallelization Setup): This code demonstrates how the GA package's parallelization capabilities will be leveraged.

# Inside calculate_optimal_gower_weights()
n_cores <- parallel::detectCores() - 1
if (n_cores > 1) {
  cl <- parallel::makeCluster(n_cores)
  doParallel::registerDoParallel(cl)
  on.exit(parallel::stopCluster(cl))

  # Export the C++ function to the cluster nodes
  parallel::clusterExport(cl, "objective_function_cpp", envir = environment())

  ga_results <- GA::ga(..., parallel = cl)
} else {
  ga_results <- GA::ga(..., parallel = FALSE)
}

2.4. Component 3: mice Integration Layer

File: R/mice.impute.gowerpmm.R

Description: The main mice.impute.gowerpmm function, which serves as the entry point for the mice framework and includes a crucial caching mechanism for performance.

Integration Snippet (Caching Mechanism): This snippet shows how the results of the expensive weight optimization will be cached within a single mice run to avoid redundant calculations.

# Inside mice.impute.gowerpmm()

# The `mice` algorithm operates in an environment where we can store cached results.
# We navigate up two frames to find the main `mice` function's environment.
mice_env <- parent.frame(n = 2) 

# Initialize the cache if it doesn't exist
if (!exists("gower_cache", envir = mice_env)) {
  assign("gower_cache", new.env(parent = emptyenv()), envir = mice_env)
}
cache <- get("gower_cache", envir = mice_env)

# Create a unique key for the current set of predictors
cache_key <- digest::digest(list(colnames(x), control$scaling))

if (exists(cache_key, envir = cache)) {
  # Cache Hit: Use the stored weights
  w <- get(cache_key, envir = cache)
} else {
  # Cache Miss: Run the expensive optimization
  opt_results <- calculate_optimal_gower_weights(x, control = control)
  w <- opt_results@weights

  # Store the result in the cache for subsequent calls
  assign(cache_key, w, envir = cache) 
}

# ... proceed with imputation using the determined weights 'w' ...
